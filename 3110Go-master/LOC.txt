Though we are below the 2000 line thresh hold, the code that is written was advanced, esspically the AI. We corresponded multiple times with our PM to help build our AI. This was done without ML based packages and training which made the development and understanding time consuming for our entire group. We collectly wanted to implment somthign that was hard to do, but might have produced less lines, as opposed to somthing easier but would have ahigh LOC. Moreover, we spent a lot of time making sure the terminal GUI was user friendly.
